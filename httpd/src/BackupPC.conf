#
# This section tells Apache which machines can access the GUI.
#
# Depending on which version of Apache you are using, you can:
# (Apache 2.2) change the "Allow from" line to allow access from
# your local network;
# (Apache 2.4) change the "Require local" line to "Require ip ..."
# to allow access from more places, see also
# https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_host.html
#
# In both cases it is recommended to NOT remove "Require valid-user"
# as removing it would make Apache no longer ask for credentials.
#
# Apache 2.2
<IfModule !authz_core_module>
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
  Allow from 127.0.0.1
  Require valid-user
</IfModule>
# Apache 2.4+
<IfModule authz_core_module>
  <RequireAll>
    Require local
    Require valid-user
  </RequireAll>
</IfModule>

#
# You can change the authorization method to LDAP or another method
# besides htaccess here if you are so inclined.
